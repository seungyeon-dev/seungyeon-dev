> Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my `h1` elements? How do I disable this? What do you mean I lose all the other base styles too?
> We hear you, but we're not convinced that simply disabling our base styles is what you really want. You don't want to have to remove annoying margins every time you use a `p` element in a piece of your dashboard UI. And I doubt you really want your blog posts to use the user-agent styles either — you want them to look _awesome_, not awful.
